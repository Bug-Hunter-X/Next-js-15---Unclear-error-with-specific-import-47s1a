This repository demonstrates a bug encountered in Next.js 15 where using a particular import statement or library leads to a cryptic error message. The error is difficult to debug due to the lack of specific information in the error message.

## Bug Description

When attempting to use a specific library or import statement (e.g., a custom component or a third-party library), the Next.js 15 application throws an error. The error message, however, is vague and doesn't provide enough details to pinpoint the source of the issue. This makes debugging the problem considerably harder.

## Reproduction Steps

2. Install dependencies using `npm install`.
3. Attempt to run the application using `npm run dev`.
4. Observe the error message in the console.

## Solution

* **Resolving version conflicts:** Ensuring compatibility between the specific library/component and the versions of other dependencies used in the project.
* **Adjusting the configuration:** In some cases, tweaking Next.js configuration settings might be necessary to resolve the error.
